I used the async/await method to run the code asynchronously and fetch data from an API endpoint. The API contains a total of 200 records, but I fetched only the first 50 and displayed them in a table format. Additionally, I included an input field to allow users to search for data based on the title.

For state management, I used Redux to store API data globally. However, since this task consists of only one component, Redux was not necessaryâ€”I could have directly managed the state within the component itself. Despite this, I implemented Redux to enhance my practical knowledge and experience.

Before integrating the API, I tested the endpoint using Postman to verify its correctness. Once I received a 200 (OK) status response, I proceeded with the implementation.

As per the task requirements, I have successfully completed the task.
